# About Me
Hi there! I'm m4ndaa.
(. >.)

Some of my hobbies/likes consist of:
 > Drawing, painting, sewing, going to concerts, festivals, lifting, listening to music, and DIY projects.

 > I love art, birds, psychology, sitcoms, horror, halloween, fall, video games, comics, fashion, collecting, and mma.

My goals are to one day go to cosmetology school and become a hairdresser, fingers crossed!
